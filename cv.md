 ### Code Example 

 #### Problem

 ##### [Find The Squares](https://www.codewars.com/kata/60908bc1d5811f0025474291) Codewars kata 

 Complete the function that takes an odd integer (0 < n < 1000000) which is the difference between two consecutive perfect squares, and return these squares as a string in the format "bigger-smaller".

 #### My Solution 

 ```
const findSquares = num => {
  let first = (num + 1) / 2;
  let second = num - first;
  return `${first * first} - ${second * second}`;
};
 ```
